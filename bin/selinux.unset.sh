# firewall - run only with a bash that is version 5.1.8 or later
#
# The "/usr/bin/env bash" command must result in using a bash that
# is version 5.1.8 or later.
#
# We could relax this version and insist on version 4.2 or later.  Versions
# of bash between 4.2 and 5.1.7 might work.  However, to be safe, we will require
# bash version 5.1.8 or later.
#
# WHY 5.1.8 and not 4.2?  This safely is done because macOS Homebrew bash we
# often use is "version 5.2.26(1)-release" or later, and the RHEL Linux bash we
# use often use is "version 5.1.8(1)-release" or later.  These versions are what
# we initially tested.  We recommend you either upgrade bash or install a newer
# version of bash and adjust your $PATH so that "/usr/bin/env bash" finds a bash
# that is version 5.1.8 or later.
#
# NOTE: The macOS shipped, as of 2024 March 15, a version of bash is something like
#       bash "version 3.2.57(1)-release".  That macOS shipped version of bash
#       will NOT work.  For users of macOS we recommend you install Homebrew,
#       (see https://brew.sh), and then run "brew install bash" which will
#       typically install it into /opt/homebrew/bin/bash, and then arrange your $PATH
#       so that "/usr/bin/env bash" finds "/opt/homebrew/bin" (or whatever the
#       Homebrew bash is).
#
# NOTE: And while MacPorts might work, we noticed a number of subtle differences
#       with some of their ported tools to suggest you might be better off
#       with installing Homebrew (see https://brew.sh).  No disrespect is intended
#       to the MacPorts team as they do a commendable job.  Nevertheless we ran
#       into enough differences with MacPorts environments to suggest you
#       might find a better experience with this tool under Homebrew instead.
