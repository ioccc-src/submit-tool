# IOCCC submit tool

This is the mechanism to upload submissions to an open
[International Obfuscated C Code Contest](https://www.ioccc.org/index.html) (IOCCC)


# Python Developer Help Wanted

Python üêç is not the native language of the [IOCCC judges](https://www.ioccc.org/judges.html).
As such, this code may fall well short of what someone fluent in python would write.

We welcome python developers submitting pull requests to improve this code ‚ÄºÔ∏è

All that we ask is that your code contributions:

- be well commented, or at least better commented than our code
- pass pylint 10/10 with a minimum of disable lines
- work as good, if not better than our code
- code contributed under the same [BSD 3-Clause License](https://github.com/ioccc-src/submit-tool/blob/master/LICENSE)


## IMPORTANT NOTE:

The examples below assume you have cd-ed into the top directory for the repo.


## To use:

On a macOS host with the docker app installed:

```sh
    # launch/run the docker app

    # to remove all stopped containers
    #
    docker container prune -f

    # remove old ioccc-submit image
    #
    docker image rm ioccc-submit

    # build new ioccc-submit image
    #
    docker build -t ioccc-submit:latest .

    # update scout-cli and review results
    #
    curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker/scout-cli/main/install.sh | sh -s --

    # optional: scan contaiers for issues
    #
    docker scout quickview

    # optional: detail issue scan of ioccc-submit
    #
    docker scout cves local://ioccc-submit:latest

    # run the ioccc-submit:latest in the backgroud
    #
    # NOTE: To run in foreground with diagnostic to the terminal,
    #       execute the following instead of "docker run -it -d ...".
    #
    #    docker run -p 8191:8191 ioccc-submit:latest
    #
    docker run -it -d -p 8191:8191 ioccc-submit:latest
```

When the `docker` command is running, launch a browser and visit
the local submit tool URL: [http://127.0.0.1:8191](http://127.0.0.1:8191).

Login using a username and password referenced in the `NOTES/INFO/pw.txt` file.

To build and run as a single command under a python activated environment:

```sh
    docker container prune -f ; \
    docker image rm ioccc-submit ; \
    docker build -t ioccc-submit:latest . && docker run -p 8191:8191 ioccc-submit:latest
```


### To test tools outside of the docker container

To setup a test outside of the docker container, create and
activate a python environment:

```sh
    rm -rf venv __pycache__ && python3 -m venv venv
    . ./venv/bin/activate
    pip install --upgrade pip
    python3 -m pip install -r ./etc/requirements.txt
```

Then run:

```sh
    python3 -i ./bin/ioccc.py
```

While that is running, open a browser at (this works under macOS):

```
    open http://127.0.0.1:8191
```

.. or do whatever the equivalent on your to enter this URL into a browser,
(alternatively you can copy and paste it into your browser):

```
    http://127.0.0.1:8191
```

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** You may find problems running `ioccc.py` due
to various things such as the tcp port being unavailable, certain
files not being ready, or the development server having issues.
Testing outside of a docker container is **NOT SUPPORTED AND MIGHT
FAIL**!

To deactivate the above python environment:

```sh
    deactivate
    rm -rf __pycache__ venv
```


## pylint

To use pylint on the code:

```sh
    rm -rf venv __pycache__ && python3 -m venv venv
    . ./venv/bin/activate
    ./bin/pychk.sh
```

FYI: Under macOS we installed pylint via pipx:

```sh
    sudo pipx --global install pylint
```

In case you don't have pipx, we installed pipx via Homebrew on macOS:

```sh
    brew install pipx
```


## bin/ioccc_passwd.py user management

While the docker image is running, access the console and
go to the `/app` directory.

The usage message of the `./bin/ioccc_passwd.py` is as follows:

```
    usage: ioccc_passwd.py [-h] [-a USER] [-u USER] [-d USER] [-p PW] [-c]
                           [-g SECS] [-n] [-A] [-U]

    Manage IOCCC submit server password file and state file

    options:
      -h, --help         show this help message and exit
      -a, --add USER     add a new user
      -u, --update USER  update a user or add if not a user
      -d, --delete USER  delete an exist user
      -p, --password PW  specify the password (def: generate random password)
      -c, --change       force a password change at next login
      -g, --grace SECS   grace seconds to change the password (def: 259200)
      -n, --nologin      disable login (def: login not explicitly disabled)
      -A, --admin        user is an admin (def: not an admin)
      -U, --UUID         generate a new UUID username and password

    ioccc_passwd.py version: 1.3.1 2024-11-03
```

For example:


### Add a new user

```sh
    ./bin/ioccc_passwd.py -a username
```

The command will output the password in plain-text.

One may add `-p password` to set the password, otherwise a random password is generated.


### Remove an old user

```sh
    ./bin/ioccc_passwd.py -d username
```


### Add a random UUID user and require them to change their password

```sh
    ./bin/ioccc_passwd.py -U -c
```


### Set the contest open and close dates

```sh
    ./bin/ioccc_passwd.py -s '2024-05-04 03:02:01.09876+00:00' -S '2025-12-31 23:59:59.999999+00:00'
```


## Set the staring and/or ending dates of the IOCCC

The starting and ending dates of the IOCCC control when `./bin/ioccc.py` allows
for submission uploads.

While the docker image is running, access the console and
go to the `/app` directory.

The usage message of the `./bin/ioccc_date.py` is as follows:

```
    usage: ioccc_date.py [-h] [-s DateTime] [-S DateTime]

    Manage IOCCC submit server password file and state file

    options:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -s, --start DateTime  set IOCCC start date in YYYY-MM-DD
                            HH:MM:SS.micros+hh:mm format
      -S, --stop DateTime   set IOCCC stop date in YYYY-MM-DD
                            HH:MM:SS.micros+hh:mm format

    ioccc_date.py version: 1.0 2024-11-15
```

When neither `-s DateTime` nor `-S DateTime` is given, then the current
IOCCC start and end values are printed.


### Set both the start and the end dates of the IOCCC

```sh
    ./bin/ioccc_date.py -s "2024-05-25 21:27:28.901234+00:00" -S "2024-10-28 00:47:00.000000-08:00"
```



## Set slot comment

To set / change the status comment of a user's slot:

```sh
    ./bin/set_slot_status.py 12345678-1234-4321-abcd-1234567890ab 0 'new slot status'
```

The usage message of the `./bin/ioccc_date.py` is as follows:

```
    usage: set_slot_status.py [-h] username slot_num status

    Manage IOCCC submit server password file and state file

    positional arguments:
      username    IOCCC submit server username
      slot_num    slot number from 0 to 9
      status      slot status string

    options:
      -h, --help  show this help message and exit

    set_slot_status.py version: 1.0 2024-11-03
```


## Disclaimer


This code is based on code originally written by Eliot Lear (@elear) in late
2021.  The [IOCCC judges](https://www.ioccc.org/judges.html) heavily modified
Eliot's code, so any fault you find should be blamed on them üòâ (that is, the
IOCCC Judges :-) ). As such, YOU should be WARNED that this code might NOT work,
or at least might not for you.

The IOCCC plans to deploy a hosted docker container to allow IOCCC
registered contestants to submit files that have been created by the
[mkiocccentry tool](https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry).

The [IOCCC judges](https://www.ioccc.org/judges.html) plan to work on
this code prior to the next IOCCC.
